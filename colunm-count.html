        <h1>The Building That Moved: How Did They Move an 11,000-Ton Telephone Exchange Without Suspending Its
            Operations?</h1>
        <p class="column1">
            In November 1930, in Indiana, United States, one of the great feats of modern engineering was
            executed: a team of architects and engineers moved an 11,000-ton (22-million pound) telephone exchange
            without ever suspending its operations either basic supplies for the 600 employees who worked inside.

            In order to comprehend this milestone, we have to go back to 1888, when the architecture firm Vonnegut, Bohn
            & Mueller (later known as Vonnegut & Bohn) was founded in Indianapolis by German-American architects Bernard
            Vonnegut and Arthur Bohn.

            In 1907, Vonnegut, Bohn & Mueller designed the Indiana Bell Building in Evansville, a 7-story building for
            the Central Union Telephone Company; an Art-Deco building later included in 1982 in the National Register of
            Historic Places of the United States for being part of the historical identity of Indianapolis as part of
            the German-American architectural legacy of the city.

            In 1929 the Indiana Bell Telephone Company acquired the Central Union, including the offices designed 20
            years earlier by German-born architects. As Indiana Bell had a large staff of employees, the initial plan
            was to demolish the building to build, in the same area, headquarters of much greater capacity. For this
            project, they commissioned Vonnegut, Bohn, & Mueller.

            The design did not comprise offices only but also featured the design of a call center which, at that time,
            was operated manually by the company's own staff. The demolition of the original building would imply an
            immediate cut in the supply of services.
